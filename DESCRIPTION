Description: 
  A comprehensive toolkit for simulating and analyzing plant microscopy datasets. 
  Provides functionality to generate synthetic object-level image classification data 
  that mimics Ilastik outputs, import and clean multiple CSVs, extract metadata from 
  file names, and conduct downstream analysis of classified structures (e.g., callose deposits). 
  Includes helper functions to summarize object counts and sizes, integrate zero-count data, 
  and perform visual and statistical comparisons between experimental groups via automated 
  boxplots, histograms, and t-tests or non-parametric alternatives. Designed to streamline 
  the data pipeline from image quantification to statistical inference.
